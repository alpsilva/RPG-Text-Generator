She has set out again to face the unknown, leaving behind her belongings and all other obligations.<br>Now she wanders, searching for one thing. A new adventure. Her goal is to find something bigger than herself.<br>Is there anything bigger than oneself? An answer to that can be found beyond the borders of this world and beyond the limits of knowledge and superstition. There is only one way to find it - try to look for yourself. <br>Gabriela wasn't always like this, though. Once upon a time she was a regular blacksmith's daughter in a village where everyone knew everyone else. But she didn't like regular things, so she tried to make other people believe she was an elf by day and a cat by night (long story). When she revealed her true identity after many years of masquerade, nobody believed her, not even her parents who had 
lways supported every whim of their strange daughter. She had no choice but to escape from her home town for good with nothing but the clothes on her back left.<br>And so it continued until Gabriella became Gabriela - an adventurer whose name is known in many lands, small villages and big cities alike - the woman who could have easily made millions just by exploiting her looks or telling fortunes or just being beautiful. She chose the road less travelled instead.<br>So here is another one trying to find something "bigger than oneself" with no protection but what nature gives you.<br><span class="wikitable" style="font-weight: bold; color: #00cc00; background-color:#ffffcc; text-align:left"> </span><ref name="BGref">[https://bg-wiki.com/bg/Gabriela_

Background Before she could speak, she learned how to kill thanks to warrior's companion Charles Vodden, one of the adults charged with bringing her up after she was sold by her father. Her friendly personality keeps his bitterness at bay. He trains her strictly and gave up barbaric training techniques cut short when he noticed that they were changing his young charge for. Refuses to wear normal clothing outside the arena under guise that - as an enemy combatant kidnapped against their will - using anything else would be construed as an act of defiance or even show offiness on the field of battle regardless
